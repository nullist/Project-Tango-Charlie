Project - "Thug City"

Intro

		Currently, I've been burning off school to fantasize about a potential exploration into the role playing world.
		I have never made a video game, and I usually lose my interest at some point down the road. However, if the stakes were a little higher, and the overall idea was substainly open ended (inifinite room for growth) adhd or not I could stay engaged. What I am currently calling "Thug City", is what could be described as a crimes simulator, but the more I try to characterize such a thing the more it sounds like a society sim. The reason I say this is because well, crime would not exist without laws, laws would not exist without a government, and a government would not exist without a body of people. I myself have an interest in macro economoics that I would love to observe  how such a concept manifests itself in a vacume. In fact as I write this, I'm learning that we all could explore various interest in creating such an entity. I wanted to get this out there before I bombarded you with my various ideas of how this world could potentially work, still listening?

FAQ

	What kind of game is this?

		A multiplayer role playing game. Ah, but what else could house such an idea?
		Numerous MMOS have been studied as a grand social experiment, which makes sense; because people are essentially living an alternative life when they play the game. Heck, some people go as far as getting married. Thier decisions and actions reflect on the mechanics of the world they are in. Call it a virtual reality if you will.

	On what scale?

		Honestly, I can not say. We are only limited by our imaginations.

	I feel like your holding back?

		I am... I feel it would only be proper to list my ideas as opposed to going off on  a rant.

	What would it look like?

		Hah, I was thinking a 2D world..?
